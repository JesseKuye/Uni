Questions:
1. What is a code repository (often also called version control system) used for? 

Code repository is used to store your source code and any related files or documents. It is also used to deal with handling programs written in different versions of a particular language.


2. Why is it advantageous to use a code repository?

Code repository is advantageous because it allows developers to collaborate on projects without worrying about which version of the programming language they’re working in.


3. Describe the different “layers” of Software that exist on a typical computer and explain why there are different layers of software. 

Application software: This is the software most of us are familiar with. It’s what we use to perform a whole raft of tasks on the computer.

System software: This is software that works “behind the scenes” and interacts primarily with the hardware devices that make up the computer.

The reason for having both is that the commands we put into the computer need to be translated into language it understands.


4. Describe what an algorithm is and explain why it is a useful “tool” to translate from a human level problem (we can think of) to a computer program. 

An algorithm is a set of human language instructions used to solve a given problem or complete a given task.


5. Write an algorithm that describes how to make scrambled eggs, try to use control words, like IF, WHEN, UNTIL, WHILE, WAIT, AND, OR.

Get a bowl
Take two eggs,
Crack the eggs into a bowl
Add a splash of milk
Add a pinch of salt
Add pepper
Whisk until thoroughly mixed
Get a pan
Add a little butter to the pan
Heat the pan on medium heat until butter melts
Pour the egg mixture into the pan
Stir occasionally until desired consistency is achieved
Serve


6. Is Idle (the Python language shell) an Interpreter or a Compiler or both? Explain your answer. 

I would say both because you can open a new window that allows you to input multiple commands before the computer executes them.
